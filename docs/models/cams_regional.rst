The `regional air quality (RAQ) production`_ of the `Copernicus Atmosphere
Monitoring Service (CAMS)`_ is based on seven state-of-the-art numerical air
quality models developed in Europe : CHIMERE from INERIS (France), EMEP from MET
Norway (Norway), EURAD-IM from University of Cologne (Germany), LOTOS-EUROS from
KNMI and TNO (Netherlands), MATCH from SMHI (Sweden), MOCAGE from METEO-FRANCE
(France) and SILAM from FMI (Finland). Common to all models, the meteorological
parameters settings (coming from the ECMWF global weather operating sytem), the
boundary conditions for chemical species (coming fron the CAMS IFS-MOZART global
production), the emissions coming from CAMS emission (for anthropic emissions
over Europe and for biomass burning).
