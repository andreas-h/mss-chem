*************************
Configuration of MSS-Chem
*************************

Configuration of MSS-Chem works similarly to MSS: by importing a module
``msschem_settings``.  This means that the file ``msschem_settings.py`` has to
be somewhere in your ``$PYTHONPATH``.

For example, the file could look like this:

.. literalinclude:: msschem_settings.py
